## INTRODUCTION
This proyect consist of the creation of a web page with various sections.
My purpose is to create an esthetically appealing website that meets the requirements that were asked for.

## SECTIONS
As mentioned above, the website is divided into several sections. The first one is the main one, which includes the general welcome page and from which the others can be accessed through the menu at the top.

The next section is topic, which includes a brief explanation of three of the most important highlights in the history of fashion. In addition, in each of them there is a link that leads to other web pages to continue reading more about each of them.

In about me, you will find a description of me, along with two images and two links to my social media at the bottom, in the Instagram and X logo. You can also download my CV from there.

Within contact, there is a form that you can fill in to contact me, although what you write will not be saved or sent.

In net there is a list of links to the web pages created by my classmates, each one indicated with its name.

Within degree there are five tables with the subjects that I will take during the five years of the degree, specifying also the semester in which they will be imparted and the credits of each one of them. In addition, in the first year subject Fundamentals of Computer Engineering, there is a link that leads to another page with a description of the subject.

## PROCESS
The development of my project has gone as follows: at the beginning, I downloaded a template from which I have been making changes so that it meets what I wanted. I started well, but later I had a problem with the images and the CV file. I realized that I didn't have everything I needed uploaded to the repository, so I did it. However, when I uploaded it, my images and the mentioned document no longer appeared on my website. I started to change all the path references as well as making the git add, commit -m, pull and push and it worked. I am glad that I made it.

## CONCLUSION
In conclusion, it is the project in which I have learned the most in this semester. I enjoyed it. I was able to shape a design that was in my head into a web page. I have learned that it is important to make sure that the repository in GitHub is well created to avoid problems like the ones I had in the final phase.
